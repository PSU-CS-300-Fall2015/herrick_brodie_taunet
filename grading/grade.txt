(Failed to follow instructions on getting repository into
class GitHub project, which meant that code was publicly
readable, which is not ideal. It also meant that it almost
didn't get graded.)

README is very brief, and does not contain license
information, nor details on how to run the program (for
example, that it requires python3). Brief but adequate
PER. SDD is not too clear about architecture; requirements
trace is nice. STP lacks any detail about actual testing.

Source code is clean and clear. Should not have copies of
RC4 code in both client and server: use a single module. Git
history is adequate, but shows an implementation over four
days.

Server does not ignore zero-length messages as required.
Client does not put a blank line after the
headers. Encryption is broken with respect to the TauNet
standard.
